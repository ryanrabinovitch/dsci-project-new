    "### INTRODUCTION: \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding knowledge is key for assessing an individual's ability to learn and apply new information. Generally, this is a challenging problem due to the fact that many people are skilled in varied fields, and thus don't necessarily have a clear idea as to how they stack up among others. Using different classifications ranging from \"very_low\" to \"high\", This data set contains a variety of potential predictor values that may help us predict an individual's knowledge level. In this analysis, we'll ask the following question: \"Which two attributes in this data set are best predictor values to help us figure out a user's knowledge level?\" We'll use the following data set: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/257/user+knowledge+modeling.zip\n",
    "This data set has 5 attributes: STG (The degree of study time for goal object materials), SCG (The degree of repetition number of user for goal object materials), STR (The degree of study time of user for related objects with goal object), LPR (The exam performance of user for related objects with goal object), PEG (The exam performance of user for goal objects), UNS (The knowledge level of user)."

    "#### Set up: \n",
    "Initially, we started by including the necessary imports to be able to read our file remotely from within the ZIP file. We then dropped the columns that would not affect our analysis such as the unnamed columns and the attribute information column. We ensured that our data file is tidy because each attribute was in its own column and each observation in its own cell. The final step of our set up was to check if we had any missing or NaN values in our dataframe; this was not the case. These steps ensured that our dataframe was ready to work with."

    "Next, we will create a correlation matrix of our dataframe to quantify the linear relationship between the attributes in our dataframe. Since our target attribute of prediction is a categorical one, it was easiest to encode our knowledge levels to be able to output a reasonable correlation matrix. The encoded dataframe and the correlation matrix can be seen below. It is clear that some attributes are less correlated with knowledge level than others; for that reason we chose to eliminate any attributes that have a consistent correlation of 0.15 or lower (absolute value). From the correlation matrix, we can see that the \"study_time_for_related_subjects\" attribute scored consistently between -0.15 and 0.15; therefore it was eliminated from our analysis as it didn't appear to have correlation with knowledge levels."
